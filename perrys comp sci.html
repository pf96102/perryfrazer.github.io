	<H2> <i> About Me! </i> </H2>
	<p> Hi, my name is Persifor Frazer. I am 20 years old. My birthday is June 2 1999. I was born and raised in Norfolk, VA. My favorite food is oysters and my favorite color is blue. Some of my hobbies include hanging out with my friends, playing lacrosse, and fly fishing. I have a dog named Jeff and he is a Golden Retreiver. He is 12 years old. Charlie is very old but he still always has alot of energy and is fun to be around. </p>
	<H2> <i> About My Family </i> </H2>
	<p> I have two brothers named Walt And Chuck. Walt is in 8th grade and Chuck is a sophmore in High School. Because we are close in age, we don't always get along. I like to tease and hang out with them, playing sports, fishing and hunting. My mom is named Paige and she is a pediatrician. My dad's name is also Perry. My dad played lacrosse at the University of Virginia and now works in Commercial Real Estate. My dad is athletic and tall. </p> 
	<H2> <i> About My Education </H2> </i>
	<p> Currently, I am a student at <A href="https://www.uga.edu"> The University of Georgia </A>. I am a Business major, and I want to maybe be a commercial real estate broker one day. I hope to work in Atlanta after i graduate. Some of my favorite classes at UGA include Computer Science,Real Estate, and Sociology. Another dream job of mine is an Investment Banker. I love finance and the stock market so I think that would be interesting. I also want to do a study abroad at some point in college, a place I would like to go would be Tanzania. </p>
